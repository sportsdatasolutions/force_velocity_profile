## Contributing Guidelines

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug 🐛 
- Discussing the current state of the code 🗣 
- Submitting a fix 🔨 
- Proposing new features 🌟 
- Becoming a maintainer 👷

## Contribute using [Github Pull Request Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

We use **Github** to host code, to track **Issues** and **Feature Requests**, as well as accept **Pull Requests**.
***PRs*** are the ***best*** way to ***propose changes*** to the codebase. We actively **welcome** your ***PRs***!

#### 1. Fork the repo, clone your fork, and create your branch from `master` with your initials in the branch name e.g.

```bash
$ git checkout -b sds/bug_fix
```

#### 2. Push your branch and submit a PR to us as soon as possible, even if it's still work in progress.

#### 3. If you've added a new feature or dependency, make sure you update the documentation.

#### 4. Make sure you use a ***linter*** in your development environment, e.g. ```pylint```.

#### 5. Finaly co-operate with maintainers to get your contribution merged!

## Report Bugs using [Github Issues](../../issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new); it's that easy! 

**Write Bug Reports** with ***detail, background, and sample code.***

We recommend having a quick read of stack overflow's [how to ask a question guideline](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask.) Also have a look at [this as a good example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report (Expected Behaviour vs Actual Behaviour).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce.
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work).
