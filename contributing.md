## Contributing Guidelines

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug üêõ 
- Discussing the current state of the code üó£ 
- Submitting a fix üî® 
- Proposing new features üåü 
- Becoming a maintainer üë∑

## Contribute using [Github Pull Request Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

We use **Github** to host code, to track **Issues** and **Feature Requests**, as well as accept **Pull Requests**.
***PRs*** are the ***best*** way to ***propose changes*** to the codebase. We actively **welcome** your ***PRs***!

**If you want to contribute, just [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this repo then use the [Pull Request](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#branch) workflow to suggest changes** e.g.

1. **Fork** this repository. As in click the fork button on the top-right hand side of this web page. You will now have a fork of this repo on your **own Github account**.

2. Proceed to creating your **new branch** (not ```main``` or ```master```). Place an **indication** of ***what*** your **suggested change** is about e.g. ```hotfix``` (spelling mistakes etc) or ```feature``` (new suggestion/content/resources etc), and your ***initials** in the **branch name** e.g. ```hotfix/dsp```.

3. Create the **changes** (you can simply edit files on Github) and **commit** to your **new branch**.

4. Open a [Pull Request](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#pr) pointing to the **original** (upstream) course repository (our maintainers will review your PR and merge should there not be any further work to do on your side).

5. If you plan on making more contributions, make sure you [sync your fork](https://adrientorris.github.io/github/how-to-update-a-forked-repository-from-the-ui-on-github) with the original repo before starting a new branch.

## Report Bugs using [Github Issues](../../issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new); it's that easy! 

**Write Bug Reports** with ***detail, background, and sample code.***

We recommend having a quick read of stack overflow's [how to ask a question guideline](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask.) Also have a look at [this as a good example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report (Expected Behaviour vs Actual Behaviour).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce.
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work).
